[h1]Functions[/h1]
[list] 
[*] Using new algorithm to increase the load of vehicle in industrial zone and further reduce the traffic flow.
[*] Rebalance extracting facility, processing facilities to make the transfer of materials more rational. It is strongly recommended to use the nearest warehouse for transshipment, which is the most efficient.
[*] Rebalance the distribution of workers.
[*] Rebalance the cost of construction and maintenance.
[*] Adjust the output rate of industrial buildings to regulate traffic.
[*] Warehouses: Warehouse construction costs and maintenance cost for storing grain were cut in half, crops warehouse workers are one-fourth of vanilla, logs, ore, and oil warehouse workers are one-half of vanilla. The premise of balance is that the number of vanilla workers exceeds 10.
[*] Processing Facility: Animal Pasture and Cattle Shed cut construction costs and maintenance cost in half, also workers were reduced to 35 percent of vanilla.
[*] Extracting Facility: Farming construction and maintenance cost is 25% of vanilla, rebalance the proportion and number of workers
[*] Custom properties for industrial buildings, including construction cost, maintenance cost, truck count, output rate, work place, and storage capacity.
[*] Toggle between mod, game, and custom settings to adjust industrial building properties.

[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1369729955&searchtext=customize+it]Customize It![/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1806759255]Customize It Extended[/url] - Rebalanced Industries Revisited will no longer be detected in these two mods, so the properties of industrial buildings can be adjusted and the properties of industrial buildings will be reset when game reoaded, so please do not attempt to modify the properties of industrial buildings. Based on Customize It Extended's performance and compatibility issues, I'll consider rewrite Customize It Extended with a more efficient working mode later.
